A Data DVD is simply a DVD that contains your final wedding video as a file.
For example, when you insert the Data DVD into your computer, it will show up
like a USB drive would. This allows you to copy the video file to your computer
and share it however you would like: email it to a friend, copy it to your phone,
or upload it to Youtube.

This addition is not common among other wedding videographers. Usually, you
buy as many regular DVDs from your videographer as you think you need; dvds
from which you cannot copy your video from.

Who else should regulate the sharing of your wedding video but you?
